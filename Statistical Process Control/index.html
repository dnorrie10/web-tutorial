            <h1>Statistical Process Control (SPC)</h1>
            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>Statistical Process Control (SPC) is a way of using statistical 
            methods and visual display of data to allow us to understand the 
            variation in a process. Deciding when the variation is natural and 
            when it needs correction is the 
            key to quality control. The three main aspects of the problem of 
            statistical process control are:</p>     
            <ul>
                <li>Detecting changes in process performance</li>
                <li>Finding the cause of the changes</li>
                <li>Making appropriate adjustments to the process</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The most commonly used tool for monitoring and analysing process 
            performance is the control chart, originally developed by Walter 
            Shewhart in the early 1920s. A control chart helps you record data
            and lets you see when an unusual event,e.g., a very high or low 
            observation compared with “typical” process performance, occurs. 
            Dr. W. Edwards Deming built upon Shewart’s work and popularised 
            it worldwide.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Control Chart</h2>
             <p>A variable which is characteristic of the process is chosen and 
             plotted as a function of time. The values will typically show some 
             scatter about the desired mean value with a given standard 
             deviation if the process is running properly. Control limits for 
             the process can be added to the chart to indicate whether or not 
             the process is within tolerance. There are a handful of control 
             charts which are commonly used. They vary slightly depending on 
             their data, but all have the same general fundamentals as displayed
             in Figure 1.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;" class="caption">Figure 1: 
            Control Chart</p>
    
            <p>Control charts have four key features:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Data points are either averages of subgroup measurements or 
                individual measurements plotted on the x/y axis and joined by a 
                line. Time is always on the x-axis.</li> 
                <li>The Average or Center Line is the average or mean of the 
                data points and is drawn across the middle section of the graph,
                usually as a heavy or solid line.</li> 
                <li>The Upper Control Limit (UCL) is drawn above the centerline 
                and often annotated as "UCL". This is often called the 
                “+ 3 sigma” line. This is explained in more detail in Control 
                Limits.</li> 
                <li>The Lower Control Limit (LCL) is drawn below the centerline 
                and often annotated as "LCL". This is called the “- 3 sigma” 
                line.</li>
            </ol>
  
            <p>A control chart gives a good visual indication of the performance 
            and can provide a great deal of useful information to an experienced 
            engineer.</p>

            <h2>3. Control Limits</h2>   
            <p>Control limits are calculated statistically from your data. They 
            are referred to as the Lower Control Limit (LCL) and the Upper 
            Control Limit (UCL) on a  control chart. These are set at 3-sigma by 
            default since this is the most commonly used limit. Control limits 
            define the zone where the observed data for a stable and consistent 
            process occurs virtually all of the time (99.7%).Any fluctuations 
            within these limits come from common causes inherent to the system, 
            such as choice of equipment, scheduled maintenance or the precision 
            of the operation that results from the design. These normal 
            fluctuations are attributed to statistical variability. An outcome 
            beyond the control limits results from a special cause. Special 
            causes are events external to the ordinary operation of a production 
            or service. Special causes indicate that there have been one or more
            fundamental changes to the process and the process is out of 
            control. Special causes need to be investigated and eliminated 
            before a control chart can be used as a quality-monitoring tool.</p>
