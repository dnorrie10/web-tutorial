            <h1>Impact of Quality on Cycle Time and Cost</h1>
            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>During the manufacture of a product and its component parts, each
            operation has at least one opportunity to create a defect. Quality 
            is defined in the ISO standard 8402 – 1986, 3.1 as: 
            ‘The totality of features and characteristics of a product or 
            service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied 
            needs.’
            The less defects present in the project, the higher the quality.
            The aim of this section is to demonstrate the relationship of 
            defects to manufacturing cycle time cost. 
</p>     
                        
            <h2>2. Defects</h2>
             <p>There are two types of defect that may creep into a product 
             during the manufacturing process:</p>
             
             <ol>
                <li>Obvious defects are easily detected and corrected 
                in-process. Inspection and testing are effective tools used to
                detect obvious defects.</li> 
                <li>Latent defects are not readily detected by normally 
                applied test and inspection methods. These will most likely
                still be in the product that is delivered to the customer</li> 
            </ol>
            <p>Manufacturing controls the creation of latent defects. The design 
            and execution of the processes used to reproduce the product is the
            major determinant of the average latent defect per unit content of 
            the product. The capability of the processes used to reproduce the
            product is the major determinant of the degree of abnormality of 
            latent defects.</p>
             
             <p>Design controls the constant failure rate. The design of the 
             product is the major determinant of the inherent (constant) failure
             rate, which will be attained by the product after all early 
             failures have been discovered and corrected. Lack of operating 
             margin or marginal overstress tend to appear as constant rate
             failures.</p>
             
             <p>Only integrated product/process design for manufacturability and 
             subsequent tight process control can eliminate latent defects 
             because this prevents these defects from being created in the first 
             place.</p> 
             
             <h2>3. Strategy to Improve Quality</h2>
             <p>The following steps can be taken to improve the quality of a 
             product:<p>
             
             <ol>
                <li>Use the fewest number of parts.</li> 
                <li>Use parts of known capability. </li> 
                <li>Use the lowest possible stress levels.</li> 
                <li>Avoid marginal over-stress.</li>
                <li>Provide maximum possible operating margins and mechanical 
                tolerances</li>
            </ol>
             
             <h2>4. Effect of defects on Manufacturing Costs</h2>
             
             <p>Defects cost money as a result of:<p>
             <ul>
             <li>Diagnostic time </li>
             <li>Repair time/Repair/Re-inspection  </li>
             <li>Extra inventory </li>
             <li>Extra labour  </li>
             <li>Extra materials </li>
             <li>Extra capacity (equipment, floor space) </li>
             <li>Extra support </li>
             <li>Cost of failure * (internal) = dpu x volume x average cost/defect </li>
             <li>Not included here is the cost of warranty and the replacement of escaping defects.</li>
             </ul>
             
             <h2>5. Inventory and Cycle Time</h2>
             <p>Inventory includes all piece parts, wafers assemblies, kits and 
             models in stockrooms, count stations, in process, and in transit to 
             and from other facilities.Inventory costs include:<p>
             
             <ul>
             <li>Cost of raw material storage</li>
             <li>Finished goods inventory </li>
             <li>Delivery times</li>
             </ul>
	 
            <p>Cycle time is the total clock or calendar time from start to 
            completion of an event. Includes move time, setup/changeover time, 
            wait time,‘first in first out’ queue time, as well as processing 
            time for manufactured product.Inventory and cycle time are related
            by the following equation:</p>

            <p>Cycle time = inventory / throughput rate</p>            
           
           <h2>6. How Defects Affect Cycle Time</h2>
           <p>Since we have seen that the distribution of defects follows the
           Poisson, then it must also be true that we can predict: </p>
           
           <ul>
           <li>The ‘test and inspection’ workload to discover defects, and </li>
           <li>The ‘analyze and repair’ workload to correct defects </li>
           <li>These two measures determine the cycle time devoted to test and
            repair, and help predict:</li>
           <li>The required capacity for test/inspection, analysis, and repair
            of equipment.</li>
           </ul>
